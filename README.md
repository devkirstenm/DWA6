# Book Connect Abstraction Challenge

# Challenge Objective

For this challenge, we were provided with a functioning version of the "Book Connect" website.

The objective is to utilize the concepts of abstraction, objects, and functions to enhance the codebase, making it more readable, maintainable, extendable, and easier to modify.

By applying higher-level concepts, such as documentation, style guides, and abstraction, the provided code was transformed into a more streamlined and comprehensible form.

# User Stories

- As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.
- As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.
- As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.
- As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.
