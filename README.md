# üìö Book Connect Abstraction Challenge

## Challenge Objective ‚ú®

For this challenge, we were provided with a functioning version of the "Book Connect" website.

The objective is to utilize the concepts of abstraction, objects, and functions to enhance the codebase, making it more readable, maintainable, extendable, and easier to modify.

By applying higher-level concepts, such as documentation, style guides, and abstraction, the provided code was transformed into a more streamlined and comprehensible form.

## Application
Abstraction was applied to the codebase to improve its organization and make it more modular and easier to understand. This was achieved by encapsulating related functionality into seperate functions, thereby promoting code reusability, while reducing duplication.

JSDoc comments were included to document the purpose, parameters, and return values of each function, and for event listeners: the event type and elements they are listening to.

Special attention was paid to style guides to make the code more readable. By applying consistent indentation, descriptive naming conventions, and formatting, the code became easier to navigate and understand.

## User Stories üìñ

- As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.
- As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.
- As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.
- As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.
- As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I don‚Äôt need to remember the entire title of a book.
- As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
